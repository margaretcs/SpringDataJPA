# Spring Boot CRUD Application with Spring Data JPA

This project is a basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built with **Spring Boot** and **Spring Data JPA**. It provides a simple interface to manage entities in a relational database, showcasing how to use Spring Data JPA for database operations.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Allows users to create, view, update, and delete records.
- **Database Integration**: Uses a relational database (e.g., MySQL) with Spring Data JPA for ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for all CRUD operations.
- **Data Validation**: Validates entity fields before saving to the database.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separates concerns for easier maintenance and development.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot for application logic and configuration.
- **ORM**: Spring Data JPA for managing database operations and Hibernate as the default JPA provider.
- **Database**: MySQL (or any relational database supported by JPA).
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf templates for server-side rendering of data (optional).
